# motion-detection-camera
Using a smartphone to make a motion detection camera. 
If someone is moving in front of it, it will take a picture. Even animals can be detected and photographed.

PIR motion sensor can detect infrared rays emitted by the human body, So PIR motion sensor is be used to detect someone is moving. 
MSP430 LaunchPad running Arduino program, it reads the sensor's signal, and after some processing and judgment, 
it outputs the corresponding control signal to the servo. The servo clicks the phone's volume button to take photos or record videos.
